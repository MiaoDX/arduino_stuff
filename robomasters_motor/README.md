PID implements on Github, and some of the codes are pretty nice:

* One seems nice: 

https://github.com/tete1030/RM_MainControl/blob/master/src/mylib/pid.c

* With many different types of motors, pretty beautiful code:

* **A pretty good one, with position and velocity closed control**, and separated chassis codebase:

https://github.com/charmyoung/ArtinxRM/tree/master/ChassisVersion_RM3510

and in `RM2015` folder, he has some Arduino MEGA2560 code.

* Projects with two PIDS (for yaw and pitch, not chassis), https://github.com/loubinglei/DJ_robomaster, same as https://github.com/FanmingL/NJURMaster.
